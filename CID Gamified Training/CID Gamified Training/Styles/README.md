## Styles

### `AdaptsToKeyboard.swift`

A view modifier that allows elements to be pushed up in the screen if a text input box is selected and the keyboard shows on screen. Currently used for the login page where the login button will move up.

### `ButtonStyle.swift`

Stores several button modifiers used. `FriendlyButtonStyle` is used for the friendly button in game sessions, and `EnemyButtonStyle` is used for the enemy button. `CustomDefaultButtonStyle` is in the same style as the other two, but is intended for other colored custom buttons.
